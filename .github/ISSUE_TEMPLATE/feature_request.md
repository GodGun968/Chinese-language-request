<!-- 
Note: This feature is for testing only. I'm not certain I'll localize your project.

Please ensure the following before submitting a request:
- Chinese users (potentially) exceed 500 and will continue to grow
- You will maintain this project to the best of your ability
- Include the translator (me) in prominent interfaces like About with clear attribution

- Spots are limited, as I can't predict the number of requests
- Stay in touch; I'll comment under issues if I have any questions
